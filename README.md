ABSTRACT
The project entitled “A STUDY ON EMPLOYEE ABSENTEEISM AT ROHIT INDIA
PVT. LTD., PUDUCHERRY” was done to evaluate the level of absenteeism of employees and
the factors influencing their absenteeism.
Absenteeism refers to the failure of the workers to report on duty without prior notice
thereof. It has been defined as “the total man shifts lost because of absences as a percentage of the
total of man shifts schedules”.
The main objective is to find the factors to prevent the absenteeism, from the total
population 126, sample of 100 is selected.
From the finding it is found that major facilities lacking inside the organization and it has
been suggested to make necessary steps to increase the medical and welfare measures.
The various statistical tools such as chi-square, percentage, weighted average method are
used in order to extract the result.

1.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE STUDY
Absenteeism:
Absence is the failure of worker to report for work when he is scheduled to the work. A
work is to be treated as absent for the purpose of this absenteeism statistics even when he does not
turn up for a week after obtaining prior permission.
K.G. Desai classified absenteeism in to two types viz, authorized absenteeism and
unauthorized absenteeism. Authorized absenteeism is permitted absenteeism i.e, taking leave prior
permission of an employer. Unauthorized absenteeism means taking leave without prior
permission of an employer.
Absence of worker on account of strike or lock out or layoff i.e, involuntary absent is not
considered as absence for the purpose of absenteeism study.
Absenteeism rate is the percentage of man days lost due to voluntary absent (both
authorized and unauthorized) to the corresponding total man days schedule to work. It can be
expressed as under:
Man, days lost (both authorized and unauthorized)
-----------------------------------------------------------X 100
Man, days scheduled to work
According to the view of K.Aswathappa, Absenteeism costs money to the organization
besides reflecting employee dissatisfaction with the company. Absenteeism is unavoidable when
the employee himself or herself falls sick, His or her dependents at home suddenly become unwell
or there is an accident inside the plant. Unavoidable absenteeism is accepted by managers and is
even sanctioned by labor laws. Avoidable absenteeism arises due to night shifts, opportunities for
moon lighting and earning extra income, indebt ness, lack of job security, unfriendly supervision
and job dissatisfaction. This absenteeism needs intervention by the management. 
2
1.2 Causes of Absenteeism:
1. Personal factors such as age, marital status, health, education, etc,.
2. Work environments such as working conditions relations with co-workers,
relations with superiors and attitude towards job.
3. Home conditions such as distance from residence, mode of conveyance, family size,
problems and responsibilities.
4. Economic factors such as subsidiary economic interests.
5. Regional factors such as legislation, politics, etc,
6. Organizational factors such as size of the company, assigned work load, nature of work,
shift arrangements. Management attitudes, personnel policies, supervisory quality, leave
facilities, fringe and medical benefits.
7. Social factors such as religion, community obligations, customs, festivals, marriages,
deaths and funerals.
Classification of absenteeism
• Innocent absenteeism - Is one in which the employee is absent from work due to genuine
cause or reason. It may be due to his illness or personal family problem or any other real
reason
• Culpable Absenteeism - is one in which a person is absent from work without any
genuine reason or cause. He may be pretending to be ill or just wanted a holiday and stay
at home. The employers have got every right to enquire as to why an employee is absent
from work. If an employee is absent because of illness he should be able to produce a
doctor's letter as and when demanded.
As per the survey conducted by US-based human capital services provider CareerBuilder,
30% of workers have called in sick when not actually ill in the past year. The sick days, legitimate
or otherwise, also become more frequent around the winter holidays, with nearly one-third of
employers reporting more employees call in sick during the holiday season, the survey found. At
the same time, 29 per cent of employers have checked up on an employee to verify that the illness 
3
is legitimate, usually by requiring a doctor's note or calling the employee later in the day. 17 per
cent of employers have fired employees for giving a fake excuse, CareerBuilder said.
The most unusual excuses given by the employees calling in sick included the employee's sobriety
tool not allowing the car to start, the worker forgetting he had a job, his or her dog having a
nervous breakdown and the employee's dead grandmother being exhumed for a police
investigation.
The survey was conducted across the US by research firm Harris Interactive on behalf of
CareerBuilder and covered nearly 2,500 human resource professionals and around 4,000 workers
across industries and company sizes. The survey further found that 31 per cent of employers
notice more number of leaves by employees for the reason sickness in winter holidays. December
is the most popular month to call in sick, with 20 per cent saying their employees call in the most
during that month. July is the next most popular month to skip out on work, followed by January
and February, it said.
The study said that next to actually being sick, the most common reasons employees call in sick
are because "they just don't feel like going to work (34%), or because they felt like they needed to
relax (29 %)." Others take the day off so they can make it to a doctor's appointment (22 %), catch
up on sleep (16 %), or for
a short and quick trip to accomplish a specific purpose, as to buy something, deliver a package, or
convey a message,often for someone else.(15 %).
There are various reasons for Employees to remain absent from work -
Reasons from the side of organization
1. Lack of satisfaction from present work
2. Poor working conditions
3. longer working hours
4
4. Dominating Boss & Seniors
5. Non Cooperating peers
6. Higher expectation
7. No growth prospects in present Company
8. Excess Work Stress
Reasons from the side of employee
1. Bad health condition of employee or his family members like spouse, children and parents.
2. Family concern disputes and problems.
3. on occasions of this family relatives.
4. Demise of close family members or relatives.
5. Appearing for examination if he is pursuing further education for career development or
promotions.
6. Sometimes due to financial problems.
7. Going on vacation is visiting other places.
8. Exceeds number of late comings limit fixed by the organization. (Say for example, any
organizations marks absent for an employee who comes late continuously for three times.
For this reason most of employees gets absent if they were late to office for third time.)
9. On the Day of sports events especially cricket.
How to Deal with Employee Absenteeism
Employee absenteeism can be difficult to address once it’s become a habit or accepted behavior
by your team. After all, you can’t force employees to show up to work on time. But instead of 
5
watching the costs of unexpected absences add up, try this six step-process to reduce employee
absenteeism:
It doesn’t matter if your business doesn’t have an official HR department or if you have five or
fifty employees. An official attendance policy makes expectations for work behavior and
disciplinary action clear to all team members. So take some time now to put together a policy
that’s fair to both you and your employees. Consider different attendance issues like scheduled
absences, unscheduled absences, and tardiness, then decide any necessary disciplinary actions and
next steps for each. It doesn’t need to be complicated. Instead, focus on creating a policy that
rules out subjectivity and defines what each type of absence means in clear, plain language
Employee absenteeism is a frequent lack of attendance at work without valid cause.
Absenteeism does not include the occasional no-call, no-show or instances that can’t be
controlled, like illness or car trouble.
According to CareerBuilder’s annual survey, employee absenteeism is currently on the rise, with
40 percent of workers in 2017 admitting they’ve called in sick in the last 12 months when they
weren’t, up from 35 percent in 2016. Reported excuses for calling in have ranged from claims that
a bear was in an employee’s yard and they were too scared to come out, to a dog swallowing their
car keys. And in 2015 alone, productivity losses linked to absenteeism cost U.S. employers
$225.8 billion annually, or $1,685 per employee.
Employee absenteeism can be difficult to address once it’s become a habit or accepted behavior
by your team. After all, you can’t force employees to show up to work on time. But instead of
watching the costs of unexpected absences add up, try this six step-process to reduce employee
absenteeism:
6
1. Create an employee attendance policy
The first step in learning how to handle employee absenteeism? Create an official employee
attendance policy. Workplace attendance should be straightforward—show up on time, as
scheduled. But in reality, figuring out how to track, document, and fix employee absenteeism can
get complicated, and come with a lot of IFTTW—if that, then what—scenarios. What if an
employee comes in 45 minutes late, but still shows up? What if they have a sick child or another
emergency? What if they don’t show up for work at all? Then what?
It doesn’t matter if your business doesn’t have an official HR department or if you have five or
fifty employees. An official attendance policy makes expectations for work behavior and
disciplinary action clear to all team members. So take some time now to put together a policy
that’s fair to both you and your employees. Consider different attendance issues like scheduled
absences, unscheduled absences, and tardiness, and then decide any necessary disciplinary actions
and next steps for each. It doesn’t need to be complicated. Instead, focus on creating a policy that
rules out subjectivity and defines what each type of absence means in clear, plain language.
Once you’re finished, don’t just stick your brand new attendance policy in a binder on the shelf or
hide it in the fine print of an employee handbook. Make sure every employee, including new
hires, has the chance to see it and is made aware of the changes. Emphasize the importance of
attendance as a shared responsibility and that everyone is expected to hold up their end of the
bargain. Have your employees sign a waiver confirming that they’ve read the policy and that they
consent to work under the new attendance requirements. It’s a good idea for your records to
confirm it in writing should any disciplinary issues arise later. And speaking of disciplinary issue.
2. Enforce your attendance policy consistently
A habit doesn’t crop up overnight. A pattern of employee absenteeism is something that develops
over time and may already be seen as accepted behavior by the time the issue lands on your desk. 
7
In order to learn how to handle employee absenteeism, you have to enforce your attendance
policy consistently, each and every time.
That doesn’t mean you can’t show employees empathy or can’t have any wiggle room for
emergencies. Instead, proactively build those situations into your policy. Have some escalation for
unscheduled absences. One may be acceptable, but two may trigger a formal review. But
remember: an unscheduled absence is much different than a “no-show.”
Texting that they’ll be late, swapping with a coworker, or calling in sick at least gives you notice
that an employee won’t make it into work as scheduled and may give you time to find a
replacement or prepare for an understaffed shift. A no-show can leave you wondering where they
are, what happened, and leave your entire team hanging. Have a different plan of action for both
attendance scenarios and apply it to all employees—including supervisors and management.
3. Keep track of employee absences
When it comes to dealing with employee attendance, it’s important to keep complete records.
How to track employee absenteeism depends on what works best for you and any shift leads or
supervisors who will be enforcing the attendance policy. One easy way to track your employees’
time is with a time clock app, which provides useful clock in/clock out notifications right away.
Every time an absence arises, make a note of it, either in your employee timekeeping system or in
an employee performance tool. Or, consider putting together a stand-alone spreadsheet just for
tracking attendance issues. Without a strategy in place for how to document employee
absenteeism, it may be hard to keep track of employee attendance and flag when one-off
unscheduled absences start to become a pattern.
8
If your team is small enough, limiting access to yourself may be enough to track employee
behavior. But if you’re not able to be everywhere at once, make sure other supervisors also have a
way of documenting absences and late arrivals—even if it’s just a separate column or a notation
on that weeks’ shift schedule.
Why document everything? Most states have legalized at-will employment, meaning employees
can be dismissed without employers having to establish “just cause” for termination. However,
that doesn’t mean you have a blank check to fire whoever you want—bad firing practices can still
put you at risk for a wrongful termination suit, and your first line of defense is a well-documented
paper trail.
Absences can also fall under the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, which provide employees with legal protection or
accommodation for different types of absence “events.” Some states have enacted mandatory paid
sick leave as well. Keep track of different absences, including both scheduled and unscheduled
absences, to make sure you’re fulfilling your legal requirements as an employer. And in the case
that you do need to let an employee go for absence-related issues, you’ll have a record that
supports your decisions.
4. Address unscheduled absences and no-show’s immediately
Absences happen. But when an employee does call in sick or fails to show up for a shift, directly
address the situation. Don’t let too much time (or even another absence) pass in between. Once
they return to work, sit down and have a conversation about what happened, why it happened, and
what’s expected of them moving forward. Make sure they know if their absence has triggered any
type of disciplinary action or a performance plan.
9
Depending on how long the absence has been, you may even want to hold a formal return-to-work
interview. Past research has shown that return-to-work interviews positively impact absence rates
and may even work better for small employers. By addressing absences first thing when they
return, employees will recognize that their behavior is taken seriously and isn’t sliding by
unnoticed.
5. Don’t just treat the symptoms, discover the cause.
Like we talked about earlier, there are valid legal reasons for extended employee absences like
FMLA or ADA compliance. For other scenarios, now’s the time to decide where you’ll draw the
line. How often can an employee call in on Fridays and Mondays before it triggers formal action?
Can they just not seem to make it in on time every other Tuesday? Is one no-show too many?
If you’re noticing a pattern in an employees’ attendance, call it out. Ask them directly why their
absences tend to fall on certain days, and use your documentation as evidence. Point out specific
times and dates and see how they respond.
You may find out there are other things outside of work impacting your employee’s attendance
and leading to excessive absences. There may have been a shift in their daycare schedule which
makes it hard to find a babysitter on certain days of the week. They may have started night classes
and be struggling to make it in on time in the mornings. In the end, it may not be the employee at
all, but their schedule.
If your employees have valid reasoning for excessive absences and their performance is strong
otherwise, find a way to correct things together. Create a performance improvement plan,
update employee availability forms, and adjust schedules where you can as needed. Set goals for
them over the next 30 days—including no more absences or tardiness. But if they’re just missing
work to kick off their weekend early, it’s time for some hard decisions.
10
The key here is not to let things go too far. Hopefully, your new employee attendance policy will
flag and correct attendance issues at their start. Keeping an open line of communication with your
employees can also help them feel comfortable discussing any issues with their work schedules
that could lead to absences.

million. Industry Sources estimate a rapid growth rate of 20% per annum across different
segments of the Cosmetics industry with an increasing demand of all types of beauty & personal
care products.

The Indian cosmetics industry is majorly categorized into skin care, hair care, oral care,
fragrances, and colour cosmetics segments. It currently has an overall market standing of USD 6.5
billion and is expected to grow to ~ USD 20bn by 2025 with a CAGR of 25%. In comparison, the
global cosmetics market is growing steadily at 4.3% CAGR and will reach ~USD 450 billion
2025. This means that by 2025, India will constitute 5% of the total global cosmetics market and
become one of the top 5 global markets by revenue. With the improving purchasing power,
demand for enhanced products and increasing image consciousness of the Indian clientele, many
international brands started establishing footprints in India – among them are Mac Cosmetics,
Avon, Estée Lauder, L’Oreal, and Willa professionals - across various retail formats. By 2020, a
pool of luxury brands such as Labiocos, Bodyography, and Victoria secret are expected to
clamour for the Indian consumer wallet and mindshare.
Social media & favorable demographics are playing an important role in spreading
awareness about cosmetics products and developing fashion consciousness, not only in metros but
also in tier-1 & 2 cities. This is a golden opportunity for many cosmetics companies to expand
beyond the top-8 cities and generate handsome revenue from all across the country. Coupled with
multiple other factors, herbal cosmetics products are driving growth due to increasing adoption, 
12
and the segment alone is expected to grow at 15%, as people become more aware of the possible
perils in consistently using chemical formulations switch to ‘safer’ herbal and Ayurvedic products
like Himalaya, Biotique, Dabur, Lotus, Patanjali, etc.. Many Indian & international brands have
been trying to seize the established player position in this segment by launching multiple products
across categories. With rising demand, luxury and super luxury brands such as Shahnaz Hussain,
Forest Essentials and Kama Ayurveda have also launched products in this space. The herbal
brands are not only catering to the domestic market but also expanding to overseas market - the
export recorded for FY 2015-16 was approximately USD 0.093mn and is expected to grow at a
20% CAGR.
The overall Beauty Business in India is growing rapidly with the cosmetics market
growing at 15-20% annually. The retail beauty and cosmetics market in India currently estimated
at USD 950 million is pegged at USD 2.68 billion by the year 2020. The beauty care market in
India is likely to become the main contributor to the growth of Indian wellness industry and it
consists of salons, cosmetic products, cosmetics treatment centers and cosmetic products. Women
contribute to over 85% of the Salon industry revenue, while men’s hair is the next wave set to hit
the Indian Salon Industry. The Indian Cosmetics Industry has seen a tremendous growth in the
last few years due to rising beauty concerns among both men and women.
Over the last five years the growth figures are:
-Cosmetic Products - 60%
-Salons - 35%;
-Cosmetic Treatments - 5%
According to a research report, the Indian cosmetics industry holds promising growth prospects
for both existing and new players. The forecast for hair and beauty industry is pegged at a per
capita annual spend of USD1.2 which is expected to grow to USD 6.2. The country’s cosmetic
sector has, in fact, emerged as one of the markets holding immense growth potential. The future
outlook seems exceptionally bright due to new product launches which are catering to consumers’
growing requirements and will fuel growth in the industry. According to the latest research 
13
report, the Indian cosmetics market registered impressive sales, and with rising purchasing power
and growing fashion consciousness, the industry is estimated to expand at an annual growth rate
of around 17%. Based on an analysis of consumer behavior, it has been observed that many
consumers are increasingly shifting towards ‘natural’ and ‘herbal’ cosmetic products as they are
associated with bio-active ingredients and safe for human skin. In addition to this, it is noticed
that women are spending more on cosmetics as they are actively earning and spending money on
grooming themselves.
It was revealed that colour cosmetics market is growing at a rapid rate in comparison to other
segments. As for the International players already present in India, there has been a slew of beauty
products makers have lined up to cash in on a business boom in India. Various luxury brands such
as Victoria Secrets, Bodyography and Labiocos are expected to clamour for the Indian consumer
wallet and mindshare by 2020. Although a slowing economy and slowdown in consumer
spending on non-essential products and services clearly haven't stopped Indian women or men
from putting up their best face. Most of the international brands are trying to cash in on the huge
appetite for foreign cosmetic brands in India amid growing spending power among the country's
large section of women, thanks to the increasing number of ladies entering the corporate
workforce every year. On an average, working women intend to spend 35% or more of their
income on themselves
India Cosmetics Market Outlook 2017-2025
The Indian cosmetics industry is continuously witnessing firm growth over the past years. As per
Goldstein Research, India cosmetics market is valued at nearly USD 11.16 billion in 2017 and is
anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5.91% during the forecast period 2017-2025. Furthermore, it is

REVIEW OF LITERATURE
*Habeebur Rahman. T,” A Study on Causes of Absenteeism among Employees in Retails
Shops, ISBR Management Journal, Volume1, Issue1, May 2016
Absenteeism is one of major human problem of Indian textiles industries. Absenteeism is
the term generally used to refer to unscheduled employee absences from the workplace. It is a
habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation. Absenteeism is a big barrier for any kind of
organization because its effect on organization growth. This research shows how absenteeism is a
big barrier for retail sector and how it’s give the inverse effect on organization growth and
development. T-Nagar is the highly crowded area in Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and everyday there
are enormous number of people visiting specially for shopping purpose. People from different
area visit T-Nagar for purchasing clothes. The textile shops earn huge amount of profit specially
during vacations, i.e., Festival season, Marriages, Birthdays, Anniversary and so on. Hence it is
important for every employee be present in the shop in order to attend the customers.. Due to this
problem the researcher has focused on “A Study on Causes of Absenteeism among Employees in
Retail Shops (With Special Reference to Textiles, T-Nagar Chennai)”, organized and unorganized
retail industry.
The CBS Interactive Network, (2007) “Reducing and Managing Workplace Absenteeism”,
Productivity loss due to absenteeism is a serious and growing challenge. In the United States, the
annual cost to employers for time lost due to accidents is almost $100 billion, and other
unscheduled worker absences costs even more. Absence management is a growing body of
knowledge and experience that managers apply to the control and reduction of these costs.
Picoars and Payers (2009) “A research study on absenteeism of employees in retail sector”
According to Picoars and Payers ‘unexpected absence disturbs the efficiency of the group as the
jobs are inter-connected, if one single man remains absent without prior notice the whole
operation process is distributed. This absenteeism results in production losses because, due to 
24
absenteeism, workers cost increases and thus efficiency of operations is affected.
Muchinsky (1997) Studies examining the psychometric properties of absence measures are
reviewed, along with the relationship between absenteeism and personal, attitudinal and
organizational variables chronic absentees into four categories such as; entrepreneurs, status
seekers, family oriented and sick and old. Absenteeism rate can be calculated for different
employees and for different time periods like month and year. The frequency rate reflects the
incidence of absence and is usually expressed as the no of separate absence in a given period,
irrespective of absence. The frequency rate represents the average no of absence per worker in a
given period
Mr. Soumik Chowdhury,” A Study of Absenteeism in a Manufacturing Company “
This is a study of absenteeism in a manufacturing company. Due to the confidentiality and not
disclosing the name of the company, the name is not been mentioned. This company provides
products and services in the automotive industry to Indian and global customers. “Employee
absenteeism is one of the most common workplace problems facing employers in today’s
workplace. Legitimate illnesses still account for the majority of employee absences, but some
studies have shown that less than one-third of absences from the workplace are related to poor
health. Most employers offer their workers vacation, sick leave, paid time off, or other kinds of
paid and unpaid leave” (Resource-HR-Employee-Law). Therefore this study concentrates on the
different parameters which influence for absenteeism Social Environment, Rewards &
Recognition, Responsibilities, Technology, etc. It is a descriptive study. The study finds out the
cause of absenteeism in the organization and according to that propose the suggestions to reduce
the absenteeism. The study is based on the survey based method with structured questionnaire
data collection. The study approached qualitatively. The respondents for this survey were selected
on the basis of their availability, such that there work routine was not affected. Sampling unit
selected for this report are the Direct and Indirect Employees of the company. The sample size for
the research is ninety.

According to Nancy C. Morse (1997) “Satisfaction refers to the level of fulfillment of one‟s
needs, wants and desire. Satisfaction depends basically upon what an individual wants from the
world, and what he gets.” (Morse, 1997)
“Employee satisfaction is the terminology used to describe whether employees are happy and
contented and fulfilling their desires and needs at work.” (SusanHeathfield).

The article report entitles A Study of Employee Absenteeism Is intended to determine the workers
condition, salary, facilities, attendance program, training programme, motivation techniques and
promotions. The article consists of objectives, limitations, company profile, research
methodology, findings, suggestions, and conclusions. The information needed for the research has
been gathered from primary and secondary data. The response given by the workers of the
company is analyzed and interpreted using different types of statistical tools which are percentage
analysis, Chi square, weighted average method. This article throws light to increase the
productivity and increase growth of an organization. The sample size of the article is 100 from the
population of 156. The questionnaire method as survey is used as a tool for collecting the primary
data. The questionnaire has been designed by the researcher according to the objective of the
study. Percentage analysis, Chi-square and weighted average are used as tools for data analysis
In the opinion of Dakely C.A. (1948) “Absenteeism is the ratio of the number of production mandays or shifts lost to the total number of production scheduled to work”.
The labour bureau (1962) defines absenteeism as the total shifts lost because of absence as
percentage of the total number of man shifts scheduled to work. Likewise Hackett J.D (1929) 
28
defines it as “the temporary cessation of work for not less than one whole working day initiative
of the worker when his presence is expected by the employer”. Similarly encyclopedia of social
science observes “Absenteeism as the time lost in industrial establishment by avoidable or
unavoidable absence of employees. The time lost by the strikes or by lateness amounting to an
hour or two is not usually included”
Knowles (1979) opined that although absence from work may be due to any of a large number of
factors, empirical evidence supporting the view that causal factors can be organizational in nature
is scant. Absence may be regarded as one facet of a wider behavioral problem pervading entire
organizational sub-units. The author suggests that absence could be used along with other
variables as a valuable personnel statistic indicating areas of organizational dysfunction. This
means that if levels of absenteeism in such cases as these were to be improved the solution should
be looked for at the organizational level rather than at the individual or job level.
Gilbert. Et.al, (1992) Studied if continuous exposure to air-conditioning during working hours has
an observable effect on health. Absenteeism from ill health recorded by company doctors was
compared in two groups of employees of the French National Electric and Gas Company in
western France, working in similar jobs and spending most of their time in either air- conditioned
offices or a natural atmosphere. No difference between the two groups was observed during the
two years studied with respect to the incidence, duration or frequency of medically-related
absences. A similar investigation of absences due only to respiratory diseases resulted in the same
conclusion. This study showed that air-conditioning has no major effects on health
Morrow. Et.al, (1999) in their study established a positive relationship between absenteeism and
voluntary turnover and a negative relationship between performance and turnover. An
examination of the turnover literature, however, reveals virtually no consideration of a possible
interaction between these two predictors of turnover. In order to test for such an interaction,
company record data were collected from a sample of nonexempt classification employees within
a large regional life insurance company. Records revealed that 113 of the company’s 816
employees had voluntarily left the firm over a 2-year period. Company data on these “leavers”
were compared with data on a random sample of 113 employees who stayed. Logistic regression, 
29
as opposed to ordinary least-squares regression, was used to determine the effects of prior
absenteeism and performance ratings on voluntary turnover, over and above the effects of
demographic factors. Results supported known relationships between absenteeism (as measured
by sick leave usage), performance ratings, and voluntary turnover, but did not reveal a significant
interaction effect, even over multiple time frames. Results are discussed in terms of the potential
uses of company record data for early detection of voluntary turnover.
Hoeven and de Jong (2007) reported that absenteeism figures are increasingly applied as an
integrated measure of health in the working population. However, a comprehensive overview of
employee well-being (compromising the relative impact of physical, psychological, and
organizational components) and how this relates to reported absence frequency and duration is
still lacking. The present study investigates these relationships. The study has been conducted in a
Dutch subsidiary of an international financial consultancy firm. Three types of data collection
were used: a web-based survey among the firm’s employees, a physical health check, and the
employees’ absence rates reported to the company. Together the questionnaire and the health
check included the following clusters of independent variables: (a) personal characteristics, (b)
job characteristics, (c) physical health, (d) self-reported well-being, and (e) perceptions of
organization and communication. Of the 5 clusters of variables, the perceptions of organization
and communication variables appeared to be the strongest predictors of absence frequency. This
study did not find the assumed relationship between physical related wellbeing and individual
absence duration. Indian industries experience absenteeism as a major personal problem
measurement of absenteeism. The measurement of absenteeism can be expressed as the ratio of
the total amount of time lost through non-attendance to the planned working time.

http://www.onlinejournal.in
Absenteeism becomes a major problem for management when employees take leave without prior
intimation. There are many reasons quoted by employees for remaining absent. Factors
contributing to absenteeism include individual and environmental factors. The various reasons
quoted are sickness, accidents, occupational diseases, poor production planning, and bad working 
30
conditions and inadequate welfare conditions, lack of trained laborers, insecurity of employment,
lack of interest and so on. The individual reasons may vary from company to company depending
on the Organizational Culture. Attitude of employees and influence of external Organizational
factors (market forces, social activities that influence industrial culture etc).
Harish K. Padmanabhan,” A Study on Impact of Employee Absenteeism in Selected
Manufacturing Industry”, International Journal of Innovations in Engineering Sciences and
Technology: MBA , volume. 01, Issue. 01
Employee Absenteeism is the major and continuous challenge which reflects high impact on
performance of organization. Employee attendance at work ensures high productivity, quality
delivery and commitment towards improving the performance of organization in terms of
efficiency and effectiveness of human resource management. Absenteeism is unpredictable in
nature and serious workplace problem that occurs at the expenses of both employers and
employees. The impact of absenteeism leads to not only leads to financial losses but also goodwill
of organization. This paper attempts to identify the causes of absenteeism and measures to
overcome the high rate of absenteeism.
According to Dakely C.A. (1948) "Absenteeism is the ratio of the number of production man-days
or shifts lost to the total number of production scheduled to work". The labour bureau (1962)
defines absenteeism as the total shifts lost because of absence as percentage of the total number of
man shifts scheduled to work.
According to Likewise Hackett J.D. (1929) defines it as "the temporary cessation of work for not
less than one whole working day initiative of the worker when his presence is expected by the
employer". Similarly encyclopedia of social science observes "Absenteeism as the time lost in
industrial establishment by avoidable or unavoidable absence of employees. The time lost by the
strikes or by lateness amounting to an hour or two is not usually included"
Ernest B. Akyeampong has written a research paper Trends and seasonality in Absenteeism. In
this paper the author focus on that at which time period the employees are more absent. In this 
31
paper he said that illness-related absences are highly seasonal, reaching a peak during the winter
months (December to February) and a trough during the summer (June to August). The high
incidence in winter is likely related to the prevalence of communicable diseases at that time,
especially colds and influenza. The low incidence during the summer may be partly because many
employees take their vacation during these months. Because of survey design, those who fall ill
during vacation will likely report “vacation‟ rather than „sickness or disability‟ as the main
reason for being away from work. Compared with the annual average, part-week absences. Are
roughly 30% more prevalent in the winter months and almost 20% less so 10 during the summer
months? Seasonality is much less evident in full week absences.
Mariajosé Romero and Young-Sun Lee have written a research paper A National Portrait of
Chronic Absenteeism in the Early Grades. In this paper he focused on the following points: (i)
How widespread is the Problem of Early Absenteeism? (ii) Does Family Incomes Impact Early
Absenteeism? (iii) What is the Impact of Early Absenteeism on Academic Achievement?
Nisam (2010) stated that stress among employees, health problems; loneliness at workplace, noncooperation of colleagues causes absenteeism at workplace
K.A. Hari Kumar (2012) stated that the rate of absenteeism in Madura Coats is very high.
Jacobson (1989) has investigated a direct relationship between monetary incentives and work
floor attendance.
Wolter H.J. Hassink & Pierre Koning (2009) find statistically significant differences in absence
patterns across groups of workers with different eligibility statuses depending on their attendance
records and whether they had previously won. One finding is that absenteeism rose among
workers who, having won already, were ineligible for further participation. Nevertheless, and
although the reduction in firm-wide absence associated with the lottery drifted from 11 2.4
percentage points to 1.1 percentage points after seven months, the authors conclude that the
lottery was of net benefit to the firm.
32
Morten Nordberg and Knut Røed have written a research paper Absenteeism, Health Insurance,
and Business Cycles. In this he wants to evaluate how the economic environment affects worker
absenteeism and he also isolate the causal effects of business cycle developments on workresumption prospects for ongoing absence spells, by conditioning on the state of the business
cycle at the moment of entry into sickness absence.
The author finds that (i) That business cycle improvements yield lower work-resumption rates
forepersons who are absent, and higher relapse rates for persons who have already resumed work.
(ii) That absence sometimes represents a health investment, in the sense that longer absence
„now‟ reduces the subsequent relapse propensity. (iii) That the work-resumption rate increases
when sickness benefits are exhausted, but that work-resumptions at this point tend to be shortlived.
Dakely C.A. (1948) “Absenteeism is the ratio of the number of production man-days or shifts lost
to the total number of production scheduled to work".
The labour bureau (1962) defines absenteeism as the total shifts lost because of absence as
percentage of the total number of man shifts scheduled to work like wise "ackett defines it as “the
temporary cessation of work for not less than one whole working day initiative of the worker
when his presence is expected by the employer” Similarly encyclopaedia of social science
observes “Absenteeism as the time lost in industrial establishment by avoidable or unavoidable
absence of employees , he time lost by the strikes or by lateness amounting to an hour or two is
not usually included”.
Knowles (1979) opined that although absence from work may be due to any of a large number of
factors empirical evidence supporting the view that causal factors can be organizational in nature
is scant. Absence may be regarded as one facet of a wider behavioral problem pervading entire
organizational sub-units, the author suggests that absence could be used along with other variables
as a 16 valuable personnel statistic indicating areas of organizational dysfunction, his means that
if levels of absenteeism in such cases as these were to be improved the solution should be looked
for at the organizational level rather than at the individual.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
4.1 RESEARCH DESIGN
“A research design is the arrangement of conditions for collection and analysis data in a
manner to combine relevance to the researcher purpose with economy in procedure”
It constitutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement and analysis of data. As such
design includes an outline of what the researcher will do form writing the hypothesis and its
operational implications to the final analysis of data.
As such the design includes an outline of what the researcher will do from writing the
hypothesis and its operational implications to the final analysis of data. More explicit, the
decisions happen to be in respect of:
What is the study about?
Why is the study being made?
Where will the study be carried out?
What type of data is required?
Where can the data found?
What periods of time will the study include?
What will be the sample design?
How will the data be analyzed?
In what style will the report be prepared?
What techniques of data collection will be used?
The Research Design undertaken for the study is Descriptive one. A study, which wants to
portray the characteristics of a group or individuals or situation, is known as Descriptive study. It
is mostly qualitative in nature. The main objective of Descriptive study is to acquire knowledge. 
34
4.2 Tools of Data Collection
1. Interview with the employees.
2. Discussion with the managers.
3. Time Office records and leave registers.
4. Handbook of Company
5. Questionnaire containing 35 questions.
4.3 DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL TOOLS USED
❖ Percentage method
❖ Chi-square test
❖ Weighted average method.
4.4 PERCENTAGE METHOD
 In this project Percentage method test was used. The percentage method is used to know
the accurate percentages of the data we took, it is easy to graph out through the percentages. The
following are the formula
 No of Respondent
 Percentage of Respondent = x 100
 Total no. of Respondents
From the above formula, we can get percentages of the data given by the respondents.
4.5 CHI-SQUARE ANALYSIS
In this project chi-square test was used. This is an analysis of technique which analyzed
the stated data in the project. It analysis the assumed data and calculated in the study. The Chisquare test is an important test amongst the several tests of significant developed by statistical. 
35
Chi-square, symbolically written as x2
(Pronounce as Ki-Spare), is a statistical measure used in
the context of sampling analysis for comparing a variance to a theoretical variance.
Formula
 (O-E) 2

 2 =
 E
O = Observed frequency
E = Expected frequency
4.6 WEIGHTED AVERAGE METHOD
❖ Weighted average can be defined as an average whose component items are multiplied by
certain values (weights) and the aggregate of the products are divided by the total of
weights.
❖ One of the limitations of simple arithmetic mean is that it gives equal importance to all
the items of the distribution.
❖ In certain cases relative importance of all the items in the distribution is not the same.
Where the importance of the items varies.
❖ It is essential to allocate weight applied but may vary in different cases. Thus weight age
is a number standing for the relative importance of the items.
4.7 SAMPLING
Research work was conducted by taking a sample of 100 employees of 126 (excluding
apprentice trainees and contract labors) from the company; the sample was sufficient and
representative for the purpose of this research work. To study the problem clearly numbers of
employees from each department were selected on the basis of the size of the department as well
as nature of the work.
Questionnaires are printed in Tamil & English for the convenience of employees and lot of
efforts had to be taken to collect the required data from the selected sample of employees 
36
representing the population.
The questions in the questionnaire are framed on the basis of the factors responsible for
absenteeism. i.e.,
1. Personal Factors - (Age, Educational qualification, marital status, income level,
etc.)
2. Environment and Social factors – (Climatic conditions, family functions, other
sources of income, festivals, Nature of dwelling, etc.,

fundamentals of health and prevention of disease is a must for all the workers. Health
education, inoculation and vaccination and periodic check ups should be introduced.
Introduction of health education and free medical check up will ensure better health for the
employees and reduce the absenteeism.
✓ Company can convene monthly meetings with employees to discuss the problems due to
absenteeism faced by the company and try to solve them. Management can also request
the department of psychology. Sociology, commerce management, social work in the near
be colleges and universities to do this job on their behalf.
✓ Employees are unable to manage their families with the income provided by the company.
To earn more or to search for income through other sources employees are taking leave. If
the wages and salaries are increase to a considerable level absenteeism can be reduced.
✓ Introducing rewards and prizes for those employees with regular and prompt attendance
may also help the management to reduce the absenteeism.
✓ Some of the chronic absentees are alcoholic workers. Management should take necessary
steps to identify these workers in the early stage and proper counseling should be given
with the help of social service organization.
